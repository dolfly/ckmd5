md5sum checker for nfo/md5 files
--------------------------------

usage:
	ckmd5 [-c] FILE1 [FILE2 ...]

ckmd5 verifies md5 checksums from .nfo and .md5 files. It has two modes:

Mode 1:
For each given file (say, FILE1.avi, FILE2.mpg, ...) ckmd5 looks for an
associated nfo or md5 file. If one is found, it scans that file for md5
checksums. Each checksum must have string 'md5' on the same line before the
actual checksum. For example, the nfo should contain a line:

        md5sum: 14758f1afd44c09b7992073ccf00b43d

It grabs those checksums, and computes md5 checksums of the given
files. Computed checksums are compared to reference checksums. If any
checksum in an associated nfo/md5 file matches that of the computed checksum,
the file is considered valid and success is returned. Otherwise an error is
returned. Note that this mode does not read filenames from nfo/md5 files like
normal 'md5sum -c md5.txt' does.

ckmd5 uses various heuristics to map files into associated nfo file names.
If '-cdX', where X is a number, is found from the file name, then it is removed
from the name. Thus foo-cd1-bar.avi would be associated with foo-bar.nfo.
The same replacement policy is used for: '-cdX', '-partX' and '-sample'.

Mode 2:
By using -c switch the ckmd5 operates like 'md5sum -c' does. It reads lines
from a given text file, and compares found checksums with checksums of files
listed in the same text file. man md5sum for more info.

Examples:

Example 1:
	Given an avi file, and an nfo file with mode 1 compliant checksums 
	inside:
		ckmd5 foo.avi
	Should report whether foo.nfo contains valid or invalid checksum.

Example 2:
	Following should return success for ckmd5:
		echo >> foo.nfo
		md5sum foo.avi >> foo.nfo
		ckmd5 -c foo.nfo

Example 3:
	Use ckmd5 like md5sum:
		ckmd5 -c md5.txt
