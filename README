md5sum checker for nfo/md5 files
--------------------------------

usage:
	ckmd5.sh FILE1 FILE2 ...

ckmd5.sh computes md5sums of parameter files, and compares the sums to
values found from associated .nfo or .md5 files.

md5test executable is provided which is similar to md5sum command. the problem
with md5sum command is that it doesn't flush stdout often enough for
impatient people wanting to see progress of md5sum computations. md5sum
command could be launched separately for each file and hence md5test would
be useless, but separate launches would also be more bloat.

example 1:
	initial setup: there exists files:
		foo.avi
		foo.nfo
			foo.nfo contains a line with 'md5' and 32 consecutive
			hex digits after the 'md5' text string.
	ckmd5.sh foo.avi
		will do following:
		1. compute the md5sum of the file foo.avi
		2. locate the md5sum from the file foo.nfo
		3. compare the md5sums, and report if okay, bad or sum not
		   found

example 2:
	initial setup: there exists files:
		redhat.linux.iso
		redhat.linux.md5
	ckmd5.sh redhat.linux.iso
		will do following:
		1. compute the md5sum of the file redhat.linux.iso
		2. locate the md5sum from the file redhat.linux.md5
		3. compare the md5sums, and report if okay, bad or sum not
		   found

requirements:
	- python 1.x or 2.x
