2005-09-02:      version 0.07
	- Added full support for md5 files generated by md5sum (1). Try:
	    md5sum files* > md5.txt
	    ckmd5 -c md5.txt
	  or
	    echo >> foo.nfo
	    md5sum files* >> foo.nfo
	    ckmd5 -c foo.nfo

	  Advantage of this mode is that md5sums can be directly appended
	  to normal nfo files.
	- Improved documentation.
	- Improved configure script to support --package-prefix switch.
	- Improved test scripts. Use 'make check' to execute test cases.
	- Checksums in nfo files are accepted without 'md5' string if they
	  are in the beginning of a line.

2004-08-25:      version 0.06
	- ckmd5 returns error code if checksum is bad, can't be found or
	  something unexpected happens

2004-01-21:      version 0.05
	- fixed a bug that ckmd5 didn't search for a file named
	  'name.md5' where 'name' has dots (an extension)

2004-01-19:      version 0.04
	- add -cd? and -part? and -sample heuristics support to find .nfo
	  names better

2004-01-18:       version 0.03
	- rewrite in pure C
	- add help and version information

2004-01-17:	version 0.02
